Urban Heat Island Impacts on Mental Health in Middle-Aged and Older Adults


# file: time-dependent cox
We utilized time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models to assess the associations of UHII and normalized LST with incident mental disorders, substance use disorder, depressive disorder, and anxiety disorder with univariable and multivariable adjustment, respectively. Multivariable models were conducted with the full adjustment for age, sex, education, income, ethnicity, WHR, healthy lifestyle, and chronic disease conditions.

We utilized time-independent Cox proportional hazard models to assess the associations of UHII and normalized LST with incident mental disorders, substance use disorder, depressive disorder, and anxiety disorder with univariable and multivariable adjustment, respectively. Multivariable models were conducted with the full adjustment for age, sex, education, income, ethnicity, WHR, healthy lifestyle, and chronic disease conditions.


# file: Main_subgroup
To further identify the potentially vulnerable populations, stratification analyses were performed by age (<60/≥60), sex (female/male), WHR (ideal/poor), hypertension (yes/no), diabetes (yes/no), and coronary artery disease (yes/no). P for interaction was assessed based on a multiplicative scale by the addition of a product term to the model for testing the statistical significance of heterogeneity.


# file: SYMPTOM_logistic 
We investigated the effects of UHII and normalized LST on 19 psychiatric symptoms with the logistic regression model in the same adjustment strategy.


# file: WM_liner
We investigated the effects of UHII and normalized LST on microstructure of WM tracts (MD and ISOVF) with the liner regression model in the same adjustment strategy.

# file: sem
SEM was utilized to investigate the significance of the pathways from UHII and normalized LST (exposure) to mental illness (outcome) via the psychiatric symptoms (mediator). The SEM was separately established for each disease, including mental disorders, substance use disorder, depressive disorder, and anxiety disorder.
